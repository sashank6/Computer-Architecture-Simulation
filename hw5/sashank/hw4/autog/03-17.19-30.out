Welcome to the Homework 4 Autograder! Let's test your code on a variety of settings.
We'll begin by testing your cache's get functions:
Test #1.Cache size  = 512B. Each block = 32B. 1-way set associative cache.
	Address = 3921 (in binary: 111101010001)
	Your getTag() returns: tag = 7 (in binary: 111)
	Yay! This is correct. +2 points.
	Your getIndex() returns: index = 7 (in binary: 1010)
	Yay! This is correct. +2 points.
	Your getBlockAddress() returns: blockAddr = 7 (in binary: 10001)
	This is incorrect. Please check your implementation.
Test #2.Cache size  = 2048B. Each block = 64B. 4-way set associative cache.
	Address = 314159265 (in binary: 10010101110011011000010100001)
	Your getTag() returns: tag = 613592 (in binary: 10010101110011011000)
	Yay! This is correct. +2 points.
	Your getIndex() returns: index = 613592 (in binary: 10)
	Yay! This is correct. +2 points.
	Your getBlockAddress() returns: blockAddr = 613592 (in binary: 100001)
	This is incorrect. Please check your implementation.
Next, we'll test your cache's miss rate and traffic calculations:
Reached insn limit of 500000. Ending Simulation...
Cache size  = 2048B. Each block = 32B.
1-way set associative cache.
Tag = 21 bits, Index = 6 bits, Offset = 5 bits
There are 64 sets total in the cache.
At this associativity, that means a total of 64 cache lines.
(Assuming a 32-bit address.)
Reached insn limit of 500000. Ending Simulation...
Processed 500000 trace lines.
Num Uops (micro-ops): 			500000
Cache Hit Rate = NaN% (Mis-rate: NaN%)
Total number of bytes transferred write-back: 0
Total number of bytes transferred write-thru: 0
	Your cache stats has the incorrect number of total accesses. Please check your implementation.
	Your traffic for the write-thru case is incorrect. Please check your implementation.
	Your traffic for the WB case is incorrect. Please check your implementation.
